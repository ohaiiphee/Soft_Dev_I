# Python Programming Homework I
This repository contains the 4 homework assignments I completed for the Software Development I class. Contents:

## Homework 1
    A script to convert currency from Euros to USD, GBP or JPY, based on user input. After conversion, a tip is suggested and the final amount is shown. Tip suggestions are based on converted input:
        - Less than 10: 10% tip
        - Between 10-100: 15% tip
        - Over 100: 20% tip

## Homework 2
    A simple hangman game with a menu with 3 choices (new game, show score, end game). Words are not repeated during a session, so after guessing all words, a new session must be started (or just add more words to the array for a longer session!)

## Homework 3
    Simulate the Austrian lottery by generating a set of 6 unique random numbers between 1-45.
    
## Homework 4
    Check the lyrics of several songs and award each one a score based on a fictional formula.The lyrics are read from the `.txt` files, and the formula was given by the prof.:
        - SAW: Sum of the lengths of all the words
        - SUW: Sum of the lengths of all unique words
        - SCAW: Sum of the counts of word lengths (all words)
        - SCUW: sum of the counts of word lengths (unique words)
                            `Score = (SCAW - SCUW) / (SAW - SUW + 1)`
