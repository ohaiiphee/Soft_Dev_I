# Python Programming Homework I
This repository contains the 4 homework assignments I completed for the Software Development I class. Contents:

## Homework 1
    A script to convert currency from Euros to USD, GBP or JPY, based on user input. After conversion, a tip is suggested and the final amount is shown. Tip suggestions are based on converted input:
        - Less than 10: 10% tip
        - Between 10-100: 15% tip
        - Over 100: 20% tip
## Homework 2
    A simple hangman game with a menu with 3 choices (new game, show score, end game). Words are not repeated during a session, so after guessing all words, a new session must be started (or just add more words to the array for a longer session!)

This repo is meant to showcase my learning journey - feedback is welcome, I am trying to improve! :)
